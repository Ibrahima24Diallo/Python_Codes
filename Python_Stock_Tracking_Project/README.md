# Stock Tracking Application: Python OOP & GUI Development Project

This project is a Python-based stock tracking application built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It enables users to manage stock data, generate financial reports, and visualize stock trends through both a text-based interface and a graphical user interface (GUI).

# Features

* Object-oriented design guided by UML class diagrams to improve modularity and maintainability
* Stock and DailyData classes implemented with inheritance to support multiple investor types like (Traditional and Robo)
* Interactive text-based menu system and a GUI built with Tkinter (Python Library)
* Web scraping and external data import (Yahoo! Finance), stored and processed using CSV files
* Stock performance visualization using Matplotlib line charts
* Unit testing to ensure accuracy of financial calculations (averages, highs/lows, price changes)


# Technologies used in this project
